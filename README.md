## Elevator Pitch:
Nonprofits spend time and money on writing grants that often don't come to fruitiion.
My product will utilize AI to help them better organize their thoughts, and reduce turnaround time on their writing. Allowing them to focus more on their missions and less on fundraising.

## Key Features:
- User accounts
- A guided process to help nonprofits organize their thoughts
- A database of anonymized successful grant applications to help guide the writing process
- AI generated applications based on the user's input
- Ability to see their past applications
